# HPI-third-project
This project is a simple console-based task manager written in Python for a college project

# Console Task Manager in Python
The program allows the user to:

- Add new tasks
- List all existing tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Exit the application

Each task is stored in memory as a small dictionary with two fields:

- `description` (string): a short description of the task
- `done` (boolean): whether the task has been completed or not

The code uses:

- Python functions to structure the algorithm
- Type hinting (`List`, `TypedDict`, etc.)
- Docstrings in English for every function
- Comments explaining the key instructions
- Clear and understandable variable and function names

## How to run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the program from the terminal:

```bash
python task_manager.py
